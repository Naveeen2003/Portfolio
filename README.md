# Portfolio — Naveen Kumar A

Lightweight static portfolio built from the attached resume (Naveen_kumar.A-CV.pdf).

Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in the `portfolio-index` folder in your browser.
2. Or serve locally (recommended):

```bash
# from the folder
npx http-server . -p 8080   # or any static server
``` 

What I built

- Responsive single-page layout
- Animated gradient background (canvas)
- Reveal-on-scroll animations
- Sections: About, Skills, Projects, Education, Certifications, Contact

If you want, I can:
- Add a contact form that mails to your address
- Optimize for SEO and add meta previews
- Deploy to GitHub Pages and provide a deployment URL
